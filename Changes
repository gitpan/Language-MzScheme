[Changes for 0.03 - June 9, 2004]

Build cleanly on SWIG 1.3.21, which we now requires.

It is now possible to insert Perl subroutines as MzScheme primitives.

Perl-based primitives can both accept and return lists of any size.

Worked around automatic "swig -shadow" on Mac OS X, by not rebuilding
lib/Language/MzScheme_in.pm by default.

All publicly supported functions from "schemex.h" are now wrapped.

Fixed ithreads building problem by setting scheme_set_stack_base().
